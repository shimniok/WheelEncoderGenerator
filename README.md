# WheelEncoderGenerator
*A cross-platform application to design and print optical encoder discs for robotics and electronics projects.*

## Jan 10, 2021
Stay tuned for an initial alpha release soon. See branch [0.3](https://github.com/shimniok/WheelEncoderGenerator/tree/0.3) 
for my current progress rewriting my [original application](https://code.google.com/archive/p/wheel-encoder-generator/) to
use Java 11 with JavaFX 13.
