On the left is the encoder disc preview, as you probably guessed. The settings are inside a pane on the right. The toolbar is across the top. Finally, if a new version is available, you'll see a notification in the lower right of the application.

## Toolbar

The toolbar at the top has buttons to open and save files, print and export your design, get help, and more.
